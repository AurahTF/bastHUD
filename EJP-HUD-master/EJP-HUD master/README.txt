In the EJP-HUD master folder you can find a Centered EJP-HUD and a lowered EJP-HUD.

If you want a centered HUD with smaller font numbers and centered charge meters, put the Centered EJP-HUD folder in your tf/custom folder.

If you want a lowered HUD with bigger font numbers and lowered charge meters, put the lowered EJP-HUD folder in your tf/custom folder.
