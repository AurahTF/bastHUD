# bastHUD

A minimalistic hud for Team Fortress 2.

# Description

A minimalistic yet detailed HUD for TF2. It includes a 16v16 and a 6v6 scoreboard, which can be toggled by turning on the minimal mode. You can customize the killstreakmeter, damage numbers etc. by replacing the .res file in your bastHUD/resource/ui folder with the desired .res file.
I made this hud for myself, but people started asking about it so i decided to put it online.
